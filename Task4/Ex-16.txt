#Ex- 16

i) def foo():
    try:
        return 1
    finally:
        return 2
k = foo()
print(k)

Output- 2
because it will first return 1 then finally block will get executed and overrite 1 with 2.

ii) def a():
    try:
        f(x, 4)
    finally:
        print('after f')
        print('after f?')
a()

Output-> will be
after f
after f?
But will also throw error for function f(x,4) which doesn't exist
